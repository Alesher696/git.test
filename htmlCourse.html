                    born and I
                    will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
                    explorer of
                    the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure

                    encounter
                    consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires
                    to obtain
                    pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and

                    procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious
                    physical
                    exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man
                    who
                    chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that

                                    encounter
                                    consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires
                                    to obtain
                                    pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and
                                    pain can
                                    procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious
                                    physical
                                    exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man
                                    who
                                    chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that
                                    produces no
                                    resultant pleasure?"</p>
                                    <p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was
                                        born and I
                                        will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
                                        explorer of
                                        the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure
                                        itself,
                                        because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally
                                        encounter
                                        consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires

                                        pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and
